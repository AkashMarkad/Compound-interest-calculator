# Compound-interest-calculator

Compound interest (or compounding interest) is the interest on a loan or deposit calculated based on both the initial principal and the accumulated interest from previous periods. Thought to have originated in 17th-century Italy, compound interest can be thought of as "interest on interest," and will make a sum grow at a faster rate than simple interest, which is calculated only on the principal amount.

Compound interest, or 'interest on interest', is calculated with the compound interest formula.
Formula -

A = P(1 + \frac{r}{n})^{nt}

A	=	final amount, 
P	=	initial principal balance, 
r	=	interest rate, 
n	=	number of times interest applied per time period, 
t	=	number of time periods elapsed.
